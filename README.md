This project goal is to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

This is done in a .html text file. The key is to use the browser's developer tools (right clicking something on the page and clicking "inspect element").
